## Initialization
There are 2 configuration files for our system.

First, the system configuration file, who choose the way to initialize the external services & database.

The text in the file should be in the format:
##
    external_services:<-option1>  
    database:<-option2>


#### 1. External Services
The external services will contain one of the following values:
* tests
* real
* 
For tests, we will not connect to the external systems and managed the requests locally.

For real time, we will connect to the external systems.


#### 2. Database
The database will contain one of the following values:
* tests
* real_init
The real_init option is for running the application with data that will load from the data configuration file(see up next about format).

The tests option is for running tests with no database, and make no writes and reads to database. The tests option is for running tests with clean database. the tests will read and write to a demo database.


The configuration file path should be:
##
    ../Server/Configuration/test_config.txt


The second configuration file contains instructions for initialized data for the market when we load the system with demo.

This file is a text file who contains instructions in the next format :
##
    <-instruction name>#<-param1>#<-param2>#<-param3>..


The configuration file path should be:
##
    ../Server/Configuration/instructions_config.txt


> [!NOTE]
> you can create some versions of instructions_config as you would like to initiate the system with your objects. Please view documentaion of function `run_instruction` in `MarketSystem.java` class to understand better.

> [!NOTE]
> to change to initiate of the external services and databases from real to test (and back) - go to class `MarketSystem.java` -> on the last line in the constractor -> put the fields `tests_config_file_path` or `real_system_config_path` as you would like.

this.init_market(real_system_config_path);
